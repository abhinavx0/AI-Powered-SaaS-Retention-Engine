# RetentionAI 🚀
**AI-Powered Personalized Retention Engine for SaaS Growth & CLV Optimization**

RetentionAI is an experimental project built using **Bolt AI’s no-code/AI coding platform**.  
It demonstrates how AI-assisted development can be leveraged to rapidly prototype SaaS solutions for **customer retention and CLV optimization**.

## 🌟 Problem
SaaS companies struggle to maximize **Customer Lifetime Value (CLV)** because they:
- Lack actionable insights into user behavior, churn risk, and upgrade potential  
- Depend on **generic campaigns** that fail to engage  
- Miss upsell/cross-sell opportunities due to poor segmentation  
- Deliver impersonal experiences that frustrate users  

---

## 💡 Solution
RetentionAI (powered by Bolt AI) explores how an **AI-driven personalization engine** can help:
- 🔮 Predict churn risk & upgrade potential  
- 📊 Segment users dynamically based on CLV, engagement patterns & churn scores  
- 📩 Deliver hyper-personalized campaigns via email, in-app nudges & push notifications  
- 🎯 Recommend product features & upgrades tailored to each user  
- 📈 Provide dashboards to track retention performance & CLV growth

## 👥 Intended Users
- Growth Managers  
- Product Managers  
- Lifecycle Marketers  

These are the teams that focus on **user retention, upsells, and long-term revenue growth**.
